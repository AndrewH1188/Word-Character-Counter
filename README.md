# Character Counter

This project has been created using most of the code from [frontendsolutions](https://www.instagram.com/frontendsolution/?igsh=MWl4NWZ4bmFxMDlrdQ%3D%3D) on Instagram who built a word counter. 

I have added media queries and used SCSS. I have had help with the JavaScript to get this to work as intended.
